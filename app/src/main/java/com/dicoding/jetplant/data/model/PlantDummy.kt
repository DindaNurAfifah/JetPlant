The petals are waxy and the centre of the flower is a different colour - just like the most common variety which has white flowers with a yellow centre. Unlike some flowering trees which bloom for a few days or weeks, frangipani flower for months.\n" +

They are at their peak from late winter to spring when they are in full bloom. Azaleas flower generously and many varieties also bloom at other times of the year, a habit called ‘spot flowering’.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "These plants are originally from Asia where they grow in woodlands. Today’s azaleas have come a long way from their wild relatives. They flower in many colours (including white, pink, salmon, lilac, purple, red and variegated) and in a range of shapes and sizes from large and single, to hose in hose (a form of azalea where that appears like one single flower in another), double or ruffled. Some azaleas are perfumed.\n" +

                "Many grown today have been bred to thrive in containers in partly shaded areas such as courtyards. For larger, stronger growers for a shrubbery, woodland garden under trees or as a hedge, seek out older varieties such as ‘Alba Magnifica’ (white), ‘Splendens’ (salmon), ‘Magnifica’ (purple) and ‘Alphonse Anderson’ (pink with white edge and dark pink throat) all of which have large, single flowers. These varieties also grow well as standards – that is, specimens trained with a single stem and ball of growth.\n" +

                "The name implies that the plant has a great affinity for gypsum and flourishes in areas that have deposits of the mineral. More well-known, Baby’s Breath's common name was coined based on the frequency it is chosen for baby shower gifts.\n" +

Taking advantage of a sunny exposure, glycine can easily grow in ordinary soil. Belonging to the Leguminous or Fabaceae family, the genus Wisteria has about 10 species of climbing plants. They are all from the United States and Asia. The plant was brought to France in 1816.

The petals resemble a classic fleur-de-lis symbol, with some petals rising up while others cascade down. The center petals stand upright and are known botanically as standards.

These petals feature markings that help direct insects toward the flower’s reproductive parts. On bearded iris, the beards—a series of hairs arranged in a line—act as a gripping agent, giving pollinators a surface to grab and hang onto as they ascend the falls petals toward the flower’s center.\n" +

Cut Dutch iris flowers when buds are showing halfway out of the green covering and the flower bud tip is starting to unfurl. Snip bearded iris stems as soon as the first blossom on a stem has started to unfurl. With both types of iris, any other buds on the stem showing a nose of color should open in the vase.\n" +
